The latex (LaTeX) template provides a simple LaTeX document and a makefile for 
building the document. By default, the document is named 'document.tex' and the 
Makefile will generate 'document.pdf'.

Usage:
    - Building
        To generate the document, run: make
        All generated files will be placed within a directory named 'build'

    - Cleaning
        To remove generated files which are created during building, run: make 
        clean

Additional Notes:
    - Requirements:
        pdflatex
        make
    - Do not place any files within the 'build' directory as the directory will 
      be removed when running 'make clean'
