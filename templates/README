This directory contains the available templates. Each template directory must 
contain an executable script named "install.sh" which accepts a single 
command-line argument specifying the installation location as follows:

install.sh -l install_location

Each template should also include a file named "README" which will be displayed 
by templates.sh (unless running in quiet mode)
